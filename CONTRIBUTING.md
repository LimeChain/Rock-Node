## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. Read this contributing guide
2. Familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
3. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
4. Join our community discussions

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75.0 or later
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-node.git
   cd rock-node
   ```

3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/rock-node.git
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Code Style

### Rust Code Style

We follow Rust community standards and use `rustfmt` for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

### Clippy

We use Clippy for additional linting:

```bash
# Run Clippy
cargo clippy

# Run Clippy with all warnings
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all
```

### Code Organization

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use appropriate error handling with `Result` and `Option`

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with doc comments
- Include examples in documentation where appropriate
- Keep README files up to date
- Update relevant documentation when adding new features

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration_test_name
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external state
- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Testing with Metrics

When writing tests that use Prometheus metrics:

- **Always use isolated registries** to prevent cardinality conflicts
- Use `rock_node_core::test_utils::create_isolated_metrics()` for test contexts
- Avoid using `MetricsRegistry::new()` directly in tests
- Follow the established patterns in existing plugins

```rust
use rock_node_core::test_utils::create_isolated_metrics;

#[test]
fn my_metrics_test() {
    let metrics = create_isolated_metrics();
    // Test implementation using isolated metrics...
}
```

See [Registry Isolation Guide](docs/registry-isolation.md) for detailed information.

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. You can check coverage with:

```bash
# Install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Run coverage analysis
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### Development Workflow

#### Recommended Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start your work
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit code ...

# 3. Run development checks (before committing)
make dev-check

# 4. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
# Pre-commit hooks run automatically

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

#### Available Make Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make install           # Setup development environment
make dev-check         # Run full development check
make quick-check       # Quick compilation check
make clean             # Clean build artifacts
make docs              # Generate documentation
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Compilation
- All code must compile without warnings
- Use `#[allow(...)]` sparingly and with justification

### Formatting
- Code must be formatted with `rustfmt`
- No manual formatting overrides

### Linting
- All clippy warnings must be addressed
- Prefer fixing the issue over allowing the lint
- Document any necessary `#[allow(...)]` with comments

### Testing
- New code should include appropriate tests
- Tests should cover both success and error paths
- Use descriptive test names: `test_function_scenario_outcome`

### Documentation
- Public APIs should have doc comments
- Use `///` for public documentation
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

The project includes several CI workflows:

- **Code Quality** ([.github/workflows/code-quality.yml](.github/workflows/code-quality.yml))
  - Formatting check
  - Clippy linting
  - Compilation check
  - Security audit
  - Pre-commit validation

- **Unit Tests** ([.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml](.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml))
  - Run unit tests across platforms
  - Generate coverage reports

- **E2E Tests** ([.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml](.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml))
  - Integration testing with Docker

### Status Checks

All PRs must pass:
- âœ… Code formatting (`cargo fmt --check`)
- âœ… Linting (`cargo clippy`)
- âœ… Compilation (`cargo check`)
- âœ… Unit tests (`cargo test`)
- âœ… Security audit (`cargo audit`)

## Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Issues

```bash
# Update hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Clear cache
pre-commit clean

# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit uninstall
pre-commit install
```

### Formatting Conflicts

```bash
# Check what rustfmt would change
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Apply formatting
cargo fmt --all
```

### Clippy Issues

```bash
# See detailed clippy output
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace

# Fix automatically fixable issues
cargo clippy --fix --all-targets --all-features --workspace
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Write tests** for new functionality

4. **Update documentation** as needed

5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new block verification feature"

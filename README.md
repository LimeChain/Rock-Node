## Overview

Rock Node is a high-performance, decentralized data-availability layer for the Hiero network. It provides a robust solution for data availability and verification, enabling efficient block storage and retrieval while maintaining decentralization.

Key features:
- High-performance block ingestion and verification
- Decentralized data availability
- Efficient block storage and retrieval
- Real-time block streaming
- Cryptographic proof generation
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Rust 1.75.0 or later
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Getting Started

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-node.git
   cd rock-node

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash

Example configuration:
```toml
[core]
log_level = "INFO"
database_path = "data/"

[plugins.observability]
enabled = true
listen_address = "0.0.0.0:9600"
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t rock-node .
docker run -p 9600:9600 rock-node
```
